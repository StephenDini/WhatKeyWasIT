# Profiles for the Device location

# Keyboard, Mouse, Jotstick, etc..

# Location of the Bound Key Function. If this is missing there is no custom key set.
# ./KeyGroup/KeyAssignment/VirtualKey

# Unsure what ./KeyGroup/KeyAssignment/Scancode is

# I think this location is the order of the keys, I only use the razer Tartus, this could be very different on a normal
# keyboard.
