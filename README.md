# WhatKeyWasIT
This program will display keybindings for Corsair products as a quick, always on top, pop up. More program compatability in progress. 

# Depends on
PyQt5 and pyqtkeybind

# Controls

### HotKeys
* Ctrl+Shift+F10: Toggles the window on and off.
* Ctrl+Shift+E: Closes the app.

### Other Functions
* Hover over the buttons to view the shortcut string.
* Click the windows background to hide the window (similar to Ctrl+Shift+F10)
* Click the drop down box to select a profile.
* Arrow Up and Down can also be used to change profiles.

# Notes
This program works better if you name your profile bindings in iCUE.

The order the keybindings are shown is determined by the order in iCUE
