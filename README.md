# WhatKeyWasIt
This program will display keybindings for Corsair products and Microsoft PowerToys Keyboard Manager as a quick, always on top, pop up. More program compatibility in progress. 

# Depends on
PyQt5 and pyqtkeybind

# Controls

### HotKeys
* Ctrl+Shift+F10: Toggles the window on and off.
* Ctrl+Shift+E: Closes the app.

### Other Functions
* Hover over the buttons to view the shortcut string.
* Click the windows background to hide the window (similar to Ctrl+Shift+F10)
* Click the drop down box to select a profile.
* Arrow Up and Down can also be used to change profiles.

# Notes
This program works better if you name your profile bindings in iCUE.

The order the keybindings are shown is determined by the order in iCUE

Microsoft Keyboard Manager will be the last page and will show if it is enabled or not(currently needs a restart to update)
